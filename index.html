    <h2>Git vs SVN</h2>
    <p>
        This isn't a stand-off, the "vs" here stands for comparison. The idea is to show the main differences between Git and SVN for the ones who already know how to work with SVN
    </p>
    <p>
        Later will jump into the Git specifics.

<section class="slide" id="git-vs-svn-basics">
    <h2>Git vs SVN - Basics to know</h2>
    <p>
        There's a couple of concepts that are good to know before starting with Git:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Repositories: With Subversion each project has a single, central repository with all the history of the repo and users checkout and commit to it. Git works differently, each user's working copy of the project carries it's own full and complete repository. This allows remote AND local branches and means that each user has locally available the history of every file up to the last remote update.
        </li>
        <li>
            URL: In Subversion the URL identifies the location of the repository and the path inside the repository, so you organize the layout of the repository and its meaning. Normally you would have trunk/, branches/ and tags/ directories. In Git the URL is just the location of the repository, and it always contains branches and tags. One of the branches is the default (normally named master). 
        </li>
        <li>
            Revisions: Subversion identifies revisions with ids of decimal numbers growing monotonically which are typically small (although they can get quickly to hundreds of thousands for large projects). That is impractical in distributed systems like Git. Git identifies revisions with SHA1 ids, which are long 160-bit numbers written in hexadecimal. It may look scary at first, but in practice it is not a big hurdle - you can refer to the latest revision by HEAD, its parent as HEAD^ and its parent as HEAD^^ = HEAD~2 (you can go on adding carrets), cut'n'paste helps a lot and you can write only the few leading digits of a revision - as long as it is unique, Git will guess the rest. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Commits: Each commit has an author and a commiter field, recording WHO and WHEN created a change and WHO commited it.
        </li>
    </ul>
