    <h1>Git History</h1>
    <p>
        Git was born from the Linux Kernel project. For most of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991-2002) they were just using archived files and passing patches. Later (2002) they started using a proprietary DVCS (yes they needed a distributed system) called BitKeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2005 the relationship between the company that developed BitKeeper and the community went sour and their free license got revoked.
    </p>
    <p>
        This caused the Linux community (and particularly Linus Torvald) to develop their own tools based on some lessons they learned from using BitKeeper:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>Simple Design</li>
        <li>Strong support for non-linear development (several parallel branches were in mind)</li>
        <li>Fully distributed</li>
        <li>Very efficient, able to handle big projects like the Linux Kerner efficiently (speed and data size)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since its creation, Git has been evolving and maturing while true to points above. It's incredibly fast, very efficient with large projects and it's branching system is excellent.
    </p>

<section class="slide" id="git-vs-svn-intro">
    <h2>Git vs SVN</h2>
    <p>
        This isn't a stand-off, the "vs" here stands for comparison. The idea is to show the main differences between Git and SVN for the ones who already know how to work with SVN
    </p>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="git-vs-svn-basics">
    <h2>Git vs SVN - Basics to know</h2>
    <p>
        There's a couple of concepts that are good to know before starting with Git:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Repositories: With Subversion each project has a single, central repository with all the history of the repo and users checkout and commit to it. Git works differently, each user's working copy of the project carries it's own full and complete repository. This allows remote AND local branches and means that each user has locally available the history of every file up to the last remote update.
        </li>
        <li>
            URL: In Subversion the URL identifies the location of the repository and the path inside the repository, so you organize the layout of the repository and its meaning. Normally you would have trunk/, branches/ and tags/ directories. In Git the URL is just the location of the repository, and it always contains branches and tags. One of the branches is the default (normally named master). 
        </li>
        <li>
            Revisions: Subversion identifies revisions with ids of decimal numbers growing monotonically which are typically small (although they can get quickly to hundreds of thousands for large projects). That is impractical in distributed systems like Git. Git identifies revisions with SHA1 ids, which are long 160-bit numbers written in hexadecimal. It may look scary at first, but in practice it is not a big hurdle - you can refer to the latest revision by HEAD, its parent as HEAD^ and its parent as HEAD^^ = HEAD~2 (you can go on adding carrets), cut'n'paste helps a lot and you can write only the few leading digits of a revision - as long as it is unique, Git will guess the rest. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Commits: Each commit has an author and a commiter field, recording WHO and WHEN created a change and WHO commited it.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="git-basics">
    <h1>Git Basics</h1>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="git-basics-snapshots">
    <h2>Snapshots, not differences</h2>
    <p>
    The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data. <br>
    While other systems store the information as a list of file-based changes (a set of files and the changes made over time) Git is more like a set of snapshots.
    </p>
    <p>
    With every commit a snapshot is taken and a reference to that snapshot is created. To improve efficiency, the files that weren't modified are not stored again (just a link to a previous identical file already stored).
    </p>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="git-basics-local">
    <h2>Most operations are local</h2>
    <p>
    Another big difference is that except for the operations that specifically involve working with remote repositories, every other operation is available locally.
    </p>
    <p>
    Consulting the history, checking the log, reverting commits. All that without the latency overhead from networks. It also means that you don't depend on a connection to a remote server to continue working. Just keep commiting until you can access the remote repository to share the work.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="git-basics-integrity">
    <h2>Integrity in Git</h2>
    <p>
    Everythig is checksummed before being stored and is then referred by that checksum. This means that it's impossible to change files behind Git's back and information cannot get lost or corrupted in transit without Git knowing about it.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="git-basics-add">
    <h2>Generally Git only adds data</h2>
    <p>
    Nearly every action in Git only adds data to the Git database. It's very difficult to make anything that is undoable or to make it erase data that was already commited.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can lose non-commited changes, but after commiting and if you regularly push to a another repository is really really difficult to lose data.
